          A rejection letter feels like a hard “no”, but it is often a snapshot of how your profile fit a specific product at a specific time. This page explains what a rejection means, what it doesn’t, and how to respond constructively.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>Reading a Credit-Card Rejection Calmly</h2>
      <p>When a card application is rejected, the issuer must usually provide a general reason or category. That notice is not a full diagnostic report, but it gives clues on what their risk model disliked: recent activity, score range, income, or existing exposure.</p>
      <p>A single rejection does not lock you out of credit indefinitely. It is a signal that, at this moment, either your profile or that specific product did not pass the issuer’s internal thresholds.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Reasons -->
    <section id="reasons" class="section">
      <h2>Typical Triggers Behind a Rejection</h2>
      <p>Issuers combine credit-report data with application details and internal policies. A decline can be driven by one strong factor or several smaller ones adding up.</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Utilisation too high:</strong> Large balances relative to limits can suggest financial strain.</li>
        <li><strong>Limited history:</strong> Short or very new files leave models with less information to work with.</li>
        <li><strong>Recent negative events:</strong> Late payments, collections or defaults weigh heavily.</li>
        <li><strong>Many recent inquiries:</strong> Multiple applications in a short period can look risky.</li>
        <li><strong>Internal bank limits:</strong> Existing cards or high total limits with the same bank may cap further exposure.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>What a Rejection Usually Does Not Mean</h2>
      <p>Rejection notices rarely mean “you can never be approved anywhere”. They also do not mean that all of your accounts are automatically viewed as unsafe. They simply reflect one issuer’s decision under its current risk rules.</p>
      <p>Different banks and card types target different customer segments. A premium travel card might reject an application that would be accepted for a basic, low-fee product with simpler requirements.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Next Steps -->
    <section id="next" class="section">
      <h2>Practical Steps After Being Rejected</h2>
      <p>The most productive response to a rejection is to slow down, review your data and adjust a few key variables before trying again.</p>
      <p>In many cases, spacing out future applications and improving one or two profile factors is enough to change outcomes over the next few months.</p>
