    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What a Rejection Usually Means</h2>
      <p>
        A rejection normally means the issuer’s internal model thinks the risk of lending to you with
        <strong>this specific card</strong> is above their comfort level. It does <strong>not</strong>
        label you as “bad with money” or permanently ineligible for all products.
      </p>
      <p>
        Issuers weigh multiple signals at once: past payment behaviour, income, existing limits, recent
        applications and how people with similar patterns have behaved historically. A small change in those
        inputs – or choosing a different product type – can lead to a different outcome next time.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- First checks -->
    <section id="checklist" class="section">
      <h2>Immediate Checklist After a Rejection</h2>
      <p>
        Before applying again, work through a simple checklist. The goal is to understand what the bank
        saw – and correct anything you can control.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Read the reasons carefully.</strong> Decline letters typically list top factors such as
          “high utilization”, “limited history” or “recent delinquencies”.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pull your credit report.</strong> Check for incorrect addresses, accounts you don’t
          recognize, or late payments that don’t match your memory.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Look at utilization.</strong> If your cards are consistently near their limits, that
          alone can push decisions towards “no”.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Count recent applications.</strong> Several new inquiries in a short time can make you
          look riskier, even if they were all declines.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Check for instability signals.</strong> Very new jobs, frequent address changes or
          recent big loans can all influence the decision.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you find factual errors on your report, most systems allow you to dispute them. The process and
        timelines depend entirely on local law and the credit bureau involved.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Rebuild plan -->
    <section id="rebuild" class="section">
      <h2>Designing a Rebuild Plan Before Your Next Application</h2>
      <p>
        Instead of “application hopping”, it is usually smarter to pause and build a deliberate plan:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Stabilise existing accounts.</strong> Pay on time, every time, and avoid new late payments.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reduce utilization where possible.</strong> Gradually bringing balances down can have a
          noticeable impact on many scoring models.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Let time work for you.</strong> A few months with fewer inquiries and stable behaviour
          can improve how your profile looks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Target cards that match your profile.</strong> For example, starter, student or secured
          products rather than premium rewards cards.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Limit new applications.</strong> Apply selectively, not to several cards in one burst.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is about improving the <em>underlying numbers</em>, not gaming the system. Lenders generally
        reward predictability and lower risk over time.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Emotional & practical side -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>The Emotional Side – and Why Panic Applying Backfires</h2>
      <p>
        It’s normal to feel embarrassed or stressed after a rejection. But reacting by sending out multiple
        new applications often creates the opposite of what you want: more inquiries, more declines and more
        damage to your profile.
      </p>
      <p>
        A calmer approach is to treat the rejection as data: “According to this bank’s model, my risk
        looks too high. What could make that picture look better six or twelve months from now?”
